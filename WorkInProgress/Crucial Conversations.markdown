Dialogue: 
The free flow of information between two or more people.

When it comes to risk, controvertial, and emotional conversatios, skilled people find a way to get all relevant information out into the open

Filling the Pool of Shared Meaning 
Each of us enters conversations with our own opinions, feelings theories and eperiences. about topic at hand. 
People who are skilled at dialogue do their best to make it safe for everyone to add their meaning to the shared pool.

The larger the shared pool, smarter the decisions.

## Start with Heart

How to stay focused on What You Really Want

> Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret

The first step to achieving the results that we really want is to fi the problem of believeing that others are the source of all ails us. 
It's our dogmatic conviction that "if we could just fix those losers all would go better"
The best way to work on "us" is to start with "me". 

**Start With Heart**

Skilled people Start with Heart. That is, they begin high-risk discussions with the right motives and they stay focussed no matter what happens.

When faced with pressure and strong opinions, we often stop worry about the goal of adding to the pool of meaning and start looking for wasy to win, punish or keep the peace.

**Winning**
Most of us don't realize that desire to win is continually driving us away from healthy dialogue. 
**Punishing**
Eventually as emotions reach their peak, our goal becomes completely perverted. We move so far away from adding meaning to the pool that now all we want is to see others suffer. 
**Keeping the peace**
We are so uncomfortable with the immediate conflict that we ccept the certainty of bad results to avoid the possibility of uncomfortable conversation.
