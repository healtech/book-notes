The Lean Startup 

Brilliant kids sitting in a dorm are inventing future, No boundaries, youthful enthusiasm. Well, eventually most of them fail. Does this ring any bell?

Why Startups Fail? 
- They tent to have a solid upfront strategy, a B Plan 
- Problem is they do not know customers well yet.
- They come from "Just do it" school of thought.
- Not adaptive 

A startup is a human institution designed to create new products and services under extreme uncertainity.

This uncertainty can be tackeled systematically though. Entrepreneurship is management and can be learned, can be done systematically.

Lean Startup Principles aim to address

Validated Learning
- It's important to measure your progress. What you can't measure, you can't improve. 
- Put all your efforts in learning what customers want.
- It's easy to kid yourself about what you think customers want. 
- 
Productivity in a startup
- It's NOT - how much stuff you build.
- It's (Validated Learning / Effort put in)
- Systematically figuring out what to build.
