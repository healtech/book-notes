People are neither fully rational nor completely selfish, and that their tastes are anything but stable.

Kahneman: 
Man has 2 systems of thought: 
System 1, our animal mind is fast, instinctive, and emotional.
System 2 is slow, deliberative, and logical.
System 1 is far more influential. Infact it guides and steers our raitonal thoughts. 

Conducting negotiations based on System 2 concepts without the tools to understand, and manipulate the System 1 emptional underpinning was like trying to make an omelet without first knowing how to crack the egg.
