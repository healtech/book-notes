## 1. The New Rules

People are neither fully rational nor completely selfish, and that their tastes are anything but stable.

Kahneman: 
Man has 2 systems of thought: 
System 1, our animal mind is fast, instinctive, and emotional.
System 2 is slow, deliberative, and logical.
System 1 is far more influential. Infact it guides and steers our raitonal thoughts. 

Conducting negotiations based on System 2 concepts without the tools to understand, and manipulate the System 1 emptional underpinning was like trying to make an omelet without first knowing how to crack the egg. 

BATNA: Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement

Negotiators have to often laser focus on the animal, emotional, and irrational.
Simple psycological tactics and strategies that worked in the field to calm people down, establish rapport, gain trust, elicit the verbalizationof needs, and persuade the other guy to learn, and easy to execute. 

> People want to be understood and accepted.
By listening intensely, a negotiator demonstrates empathy and shows a sincere desire to better understand waht other side is experiencing.

Tactical Empathy: This is listening as a martial art, balancing the subtle behaviors of emotional intelligence ad the assertive skills of influence, to gain access to mind of another person. 

> Life is a Negotiation

Negotiation serves two distinct, vital life functions -- information gathering and behavior influencing.
And do so in relationship-affirming way. 
It simply means playing the emotional game htat human society is set up for. You get what you ask for, you just have to ask correctly.

Negotiation is emotional intelligence on steroids.

## 10. Find the Black Swan

Black Swans are those *unknown unknonws* -- whose unearthing has game-changing effects on a negotiation dynamic. 
Black Swan theory tells us that things happen that were previously thought to be impossible -- or never thought of at all. 

Hypothesize that in every negotiation, each side is in possession of atleast three Black Swans.

Finding and acting on black swans mandates a shift in mindset. It's not easy.
What you dont know can kill you, or your deal. 

To uncover the unknowns, we must interrogate our world, must put out on a call, and intensely listen to the response. Ask a lot of questions. Read the non verbal clues and alway voice your observations with your counterpart. 
You have to fel for the truth behind the camouflag; you have to note the small pauses that suggesst discomfort and lies.

Black Swans are not always highly proprietary or closely guarded information, they might be innocuous information. 
Your counterpart always has pieces of information whose value they do not understand. 


### THE THREE TYPE OF LEVERAGES 

Black Swans are leverage multipliers. 
Leverage = f(time, necessity, competition, ... )
If they are talking to you, you have levarage. 
As a negotiator, you should always be aware of which side, at any given moment, feels they have the most to loose if negotiations collapse. 
3 kinds: Positive, Negative and Normative

#### Positive Leverage 
#### Negative Leverage 
#### Normative Leverage 


#### Get Face Time
Black Swans are incredibly hard to uncover if you are literally not at the table.
"You got to get him to the dinner"
Hunting for Black Swans is also effective during the unguarded moments.
