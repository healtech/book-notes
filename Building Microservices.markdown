#### Disclaimer
Following are the notes that I made while reading the book. This is not intended to be a replacement for the book; but a complement. I have taken liberty to explain concepts slightly differently and add additional references wherever I felt the need.

### What are Microservices?
Microservices are small, independently deployable, autonomous services that work together.
THey are small and focussed on doing one thing well.
Microservices takes the approach of Single Responsibility Principle to independent services.
Microservices architecture asks you to break down your system in to multiple such microservices which interact with each other to accomplish the larger goal. 

#### How small can it go ?
Smaller services => More number of services => more independence => More [operational complexity](https://github.com/msjaiswal/book-notes/blob/master/Effective%20Engineer.markdown#reduce-operational-complexity).
It's turns out to be a tradeoff about how small you can make your microservice.
Nanoservice is an antipattern where a service is too fine-grained.
A nanoservice is a service whose overhead (communications, maintenance, and so on) outweighs its utility.


#### Advantages of Microservice Architecture.
- Autonomous: Can be deployed independently. All communications via network calls. Exposes an API.
- Technology Heterogeneity: Different part of systems can use different technology stack if needed for better performance. But multiple technologies comes with an overhead - operational understanding of multiple technology stacks.
- Resilience: Microservices can provide resiliency by introducing redundancy.
- Scaling - One part of the system can move to another machine.
- Ease of Deployment: Individual microservices can be deployed independently in contrast with deploying whole Monolith 
- Organization: Different microservices can be owned by different teams.
- Composability: Reuse of functionality. Same microservice can be used for different purpose. Unix Philosophy.

#### Shared Libraries
Code must not shared between microservices as far as possible. Some disadvantages of shared code:
- You loose true heterogeneity.
- Unless using dlls, you cannot deploy a new library without deploying the entire process.
- What is ok?
  -  Shared Code that isn't specific to business domain and needs to be reused is fine.
- What's not ok?
  - Shared code to communicate between services is NOT good at all. 

#### Evolutionary Architect
In contrast to old notions of being an architect, author proposes a new guiding principle for being an architect. 
He says: "Our architects need to shift their thinking away from creating the perfect end product, and instead focus on helping create a framework in which the right systems can emerge, and continue to grow as we learn more."

Some generic points about being architect:
- Architects are incharge of making sure we have a joined-up technical vision, the one that delivers the system customer needs. 
- Architects have a direct impact on the quality of systems, on their organisation's ability to respond to change.
- Be worried about what happens between the services and be liberal about what happens inside them.

#### A Principled Approach
Making decisions in system design is all about tradeoffs and microservices architecture gives us a lot of tradeoffs to make. Principles are the rules you have made to align what you are doing in to some larger goal, and will sometimes change. Having a set of guiding principles help you go a long way to keep the system coherent.
- Example: [12 factor app](https://12factor.net/)
- Generally speaking, fewer than 10 principles suffice.

In addition to principle, some **practices** are necessary:
- Practices sometimes reflect constraints. Example: Only Centos is allowed.
- The key point is that there is value in having overarching ideas that guide how the system evolves, and in having enough detail so that people know how to implement those ideas.

#### The Required Standard 
- Define what is a "good citizen" service in your system?
- "It needs to be a cohesive system made of may small parts with autonomous life cycles but all coming together." - Ben Christensen, Netflix
- Define clear set of attributes that each service should have.

#### Monitoring
- This has to be a system-wide view and not service-specific view.
- All services should emit health information in same way - keep it standardised. 

#### Architectural Safety
- We cannot afford for one badly behaved service to ruin the party for everyone.
- Services should shield themselves from unhealthy, downstream calls.

#### Governance through code
- Being an architect is as much as about people as much as it appears to be about the code. 
- I recommed reading [Debugging Teams](https://github.com/msjaiswal/book-notes/blob/master/Debugging%20Teams(Coming%20Soon).markdown). It talks in great detail about human factors in software development and how software engineering is a Team Sport. 
                  
#### Technical Debt

- It's a metaphor to understand the efffects of writing bad code under certain circumstances.
- Doing things in a quick and dirty way to deliver a project leads to technical debt.
- Like a financial debt, the technical debt incurs interest payments, which come in the form of the extra effort that we have to do in future development because of the quick and dirty design choices. 
- We can choose to continue paying the interest, or we can pay down the principal by 'refactoring' the quick and dirty design into the better design.
- A mess is not a technical debt though. Messy code designed by people ignorant of design principles is just bad code.
- Sometimes, technical debt is introduced because vision changes.
- Having some view as to the level of debt, and where to get involved, is important. 


#### Governance and leading from centre.

- Architects need to make sure that there is a set of guiding principles that match the organization's strategy.
- Make sure that these principle do not require working practices that makes developers miserable.

### How to Model services

#### What makes a good service - loose coupling and high cohesion.

**Loose Coupling**: Change is one service should not require a change in another.
**High Cohesion**: We want realted code to sit together and unrelated code to sit elsewhere. If we want to change something, we should be making change at one place.            


#### Bounded Context

- In each bounded context, there are things that do no need to be communicated outside that bounded context.
- Each bounded context decide what models to share with other contexts.
- Microservices cleanly align to bounded contexts.   

### Integration

- Keep you API technology agnostic
- Make your service simple to consume
- Hide internal implementation details 

#### How to choose integration-method/communication between microservices:
- Shared Database - avoid as much as possible.             
- Synchronous is bad. Asynchronous is good.
  - RPC, REST & HTTP :unamused:
  - Async :smile: Example: gearman, Active MQ etc.
- Read this book: Enterprise Integration Patterns - (Addison Weasley)        

#### DRY and Perils of code sharing in Microservices
- If your shared code ever leakes outside your service boundary, you have introduced a potential form of coupling.           
- Using common code like logging libraries is fine, as they are internal concepts that are invisible to the outside world.
- Don't voilate DRY within a microservice but be relaxed about violating DRY across all services.            

#### Client Libraries
- Netflix client libraries include service discovery, failure modes, logging and other aspects that aren't actually about the nature of the service itself.
- Make sure that these client libraries do not lead to coupling between services.

#### Versioning
- Avoid for as long as possible.
- Coexist old and new version of microservice. Transition gradually.

### Splitting a Monolith
- Create as many seams as possible. A seam is a portion of code that can be treated in solation.
- Various reasons to split a monolith: to increase pace, adapt to team structure or technology, tangled dependencies etc.
- TODO ... Transactional Boundaries
- Always make small incremental changes when splitting the monolith.

### Deployment
- Continuous Integration
- TODO

### Testing 
- Automated testcases are the key. No surprises here.
- Unit Tests, Service tests and end-to-end tests are various techniques.
- Smaller scoped tests lead to quick feedback loop.
- End-to-end testing is hard and has many downsides. Take long time to run => long feedback cycles.
- Prefer more small scoped tests and avoid end-to-end tests. 
- Optimize for time to discovery of bugs. 

### Monitoring
- Monitor the small things, and use aggregation to see the bigger picture.
- Kibana for aggregated view, Graphite
- Services should expose basic metrics themselves.
- Using fake events for Synthetic transaction and [semantic monitoring](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/semantic-monitoring).
- Cascade Failures are dangerous. Solution: Circuit breaker.
- Monitoring is one area where standardization is incredibly important. Write your logs out in a standard format and at standard location.
- Have a single, queryable tool for aggregating and storing logs.

### Security
- TODO
- Don’t write your own crypto. Don’t invent your own security protocols.

### Conway's Law
- Any organization that designs ssystem is constrained to produce design that copies the communication structure of the organization.
- If you have 4 groups working on a compiler, you will get a 4 pass compiler.
=> More loosely coupled organizations actually created more modular, less coupled systems.
=> 2 pizza teams.
- Geographically distributed teams produce loosely coupled system.
- Service ownership - building, deploying and maintaining the service.
- Service ownership gives people more power and autonomy, making them more accountable
- Internal Open Source - A small group of people are core committers. Core committers are still in charge of the codebase; they are owners.
- Along with service boundaries, align your team along bounded contexts too.
- Trying to enforce a system design that doesn't match the organization can lead to tension.  

### TODO (Still to Read)
He talks about bunch of other stuff that I am still to read and implement in my company. Here is a list:
- Environments
- Service Configuration
- PaaS
- Containers, vagrant, docker and what not    


### Microservices at Scale
- Failure is inevitable.
- Instead of trying to avoid failures, design for resiliency. 
- With monolithic systems, health is binary. For MS based architectures, ask yourself "what happens if this service goes down?"
- Embrace and Incite Failures
- Netflix uses Chaos Monkey to simulate failures. 
  - Sweat in peace so that you dont blood in War. 

#### Techniques for Handling Failures:
- Timeouts.
  - Wait too long and you will slow down the system. 
  - Give up too quickly, a working call might appear faulty.
  - Having no timeouts can hang your system!
- Circuit Breakers
- Isolation
- Idempotent

#### Scaling
- Verical Scaling i.e. bigger boxes
- Splitting Workloads
  - Maximum one microservice per box. Preferred Option.
- Load Balancing  
  - Useful when there are multiple boxes serving a single microservice.
- Worker based systems

#### Scaling Database
- Scaling for Reads
  - Most services are read heavy.
  - Caching. Read Replicas.
- Scaling for Writes
  - Sharding
- CQRS - Command Query Responsibility Segregation

#### Caching
- ....

#### Autoscaling
- Reactive or Predictive
- Benefits: Cost Saving

#### CAP Theorem
- Pick any two: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
- Sacrificing Consistency
  - These are eventually consistent.
- Sacrificing Availability
  - Distributed consistency is hard. 
  - Distributed transactions, even harder.
- AP systems scale more easily and are simpler to build
- CP system require more work due to the challenges in supporting distributed consistency.

#### Service Discovery
- knowing where on earth everything is
- Gets complicated when we are constantly destroying and deploying new instances of services.
- Strategies: 1. "I am here" .... 
- Common Solutions:
  - DNS
  - Dynamic Service registries
    - Serices registers themselves with some central registry.
    - Zookeeper, Consul 
- Whatever system you pick, make sure you have tools available that let you build reports and dashboards on top of these registries to create displays for humans, not just for computers.

#### The Self-Describing System
- Have a place where humans can record information about the service.
- Getting a picture of our system and how it is behaving is important.
- Making this information readily available is key to managing the complexity at scale.

### Bringing it all together
- Model Around Business Concepts. Use bounded contexts to define potential domain boundaries.
- Adopt a culture of automation. Automated testing.
- Hide implementation details. Services should hide their databases.
- Decentralize All the Things
  - Ensure teams own their services.
  - Use "Internal Open Source", allows people to change services owned by other teams.
  - Align teams to make Conway's law work for you.
  - Embrace Shared governance Model. All teams collectively share responsibility for evolving architecture.
- Independently Deployable
- Isolate Failure
- Highly Observable
  - We need a joined-up view of what is happening.
  - Monitoring, logs and stats. Levarage multiple vantage points to get a view of system.
- Go incrementally. Break your system apart piece by piece, learning as you go. And get used to it: in many ways, the discipline to continually change and evolve our systems is a far more important lesson to learn than any other.
