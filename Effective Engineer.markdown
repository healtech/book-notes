### What's an Effective Engineer? 
- They are the people who get things done. Effective Engineers produce results. 

## Adopt the Right Mindsets

### Focus on High Leverage Activities
- Leverage = Impact Produced / Time Invested
- Use Leverage as Your Yardstick for Effectiveness
- 80% of the impact comes from 20% of the work.
- Focus on high leverage and not just easy wins.

### Optimize for Learning 
- Change jobs if you have to. 
- Optimizing for learning is high leverage. 
- Adopt a growth mindset. 
  - Talk to people. Become good at telling stories. It gets better with time. 
  - Those with a growth mindset believe that they can cultivate and grow their intelligence and skills through effort.
  - Own your story.

- Invest in the rate of learning
  - Compounding leads to exponential growth. Earlier the compounding starts, the better. 
  - Working on unchallenging tasks is a huge opportunity cost. You missed out on compounded learning. 
  - Prioritize learning over profitability.
  - Invest your time in activities with the highest learning rate.
  
- Seek Work Environments Conducive to Learning
  - Fast Growth: Companies where #problems >> #resources. Opportunity to choose high impact work.
  - Make sure you are working on high priority projects. 
  - Openness: Look for culture with curiosity, where everyone is encouraged to ask questions.
  - Fast Paced. 
  - People smarter than you.
  - Autonomy: Freedom to choose what to work on. Smaller comanies => More autonomy.
   
- While on Job
  - Make a daily habit of acquiring new skills.
  - Read code written by brilliant engineers. 
  - Jump fearlessly into code you don't know.
  - Always be learning. Invest in skills that are in high demand.
  - Read Books. Attend Conferences.
  - Build and maintain strong relationships.

### Prioritize Regularly
- Opportunity cost on working on wrong ideas can set back growth by years. 
- Prioritize tasks based on ROI
- Regular prioritization is high leverage activity. 

- On TODO Lists
  - Maintain a 'single' todo lists where all tasks are listed. 
  - Don't try to remember stuff. Brain is bad at remembering. It's rather good at processing. 
- Ask yourself regularly: Is this the most important thing I wshould be working on ? 
- Focus on what directly produces value. 
- Learn to say NO.
- Focus on the important and non-urgent.
- Find ways to get into flow. “A state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems.”
- When possible, preserve larger blocks of focused time in your schedule.
- Limit the amount of Work in Progress.
  - Cost of context switching is high.
- Prioritizing is difficult. 
- Prioritization is high leverage. It has huge impact on your ability to get right things done.


### Invest in Iteration Speed 
- Continuous Deployment is high leverage.
  - Will save a lot of time in manual deployment of code.They are the people who get things done. Effective Engineers produce results. 
- Move Fast to Learn Fast
  - Move fast and break things.
  - Moving fast enables us to build more things and learn at faster rate. 
- Invest in time saving tools.
  - If you have to do something more than twwise, write a tool the third time. 
  - Tools are multipliers that allow your to scale your impact beyond the confines of a day.
  - Faster tools get used more often.
  - Faster tools can enable new workflows that previously weren't possible.
  - Productivity skyrockets with tools.
  - Time saving property of tools also scale with team adoption.
- Shorten your debugging and Validation Loops
  - Extra time spent in optimizing debugging workflow can help you fix annoying bugs with less headache.
  - Debugging is hard. It's time conuming. Upfront investments to shorten debugging loops are worth it. 

- Master you Programming Environment  
  - One editor. One high level language. Shell. Keyboard > Mouse. Automate manual workflows. Use interactive shell. Make running specific tests easy.
** Faster you can iterate, faster you can learn.** 

### Reduce Operational Complexity
- Keep no. of technologies low. Don’t sway towards shiny new technologies.
- Do the simple thing first
- ** Simplicity **
- Simplify the architecture to reduce their operational burden. 
- “What’s the simplest solution that can get the job done while also reducing our future operational burden?” 

### Fail Fast 
- doesn’t necessarily mean crashing your programs for users 
- fail-fast  to surface issues immediately 

### Relentlessly Automate
- Automating mechanics is good.
- Automating decision making - no.
- Hone Your Ability to Respond and Recover Quickly 
    - Leverage ( Recovering quickly ) > Leverage ( Preventing Failures )
- “script for success,” practice failure scenarios, and work on our ability to recover quickly. 

**"You’re a staff engineer if you’re making a whole team better than it would be otherwise. You’re a principal engineer if you’re making the whole company better than it would be otherwise. And you’re distinguished if you’re improving the industry.”**
￼
- Automated testcases lead to higher confidence when refactoring.
- Write test cases when the code is fresh in mind.
- Don’t be dogmatic about 100% code coverage.
- Value of tests increases over time and cost to write goes down. 

### Technical Debt
- Taking technical debt is fine as far as it is repaid within time. 

### Measure What You Want to Improve
- If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it 
- Good Metric
    - They help you focus on the right things 
    - Drives forward progress.
- The metric you choose influences your decisions and behavior. 
- Choose metrics that  
    - 1) maximize impact, 
    - 2) are actionable, 
    - 3) are responsive yet robust. 
    
### Instagram
1. Simplicity
2. Optimise for Operational Complexity
3. Instrument Everything

- Surround yourself with great advisors


### Iteration Speed

- Continuous deployment to support rapid validation.
- High test coverage to reduce build and site breakages.
- Fast unit tests to encourage people to run them.
- Fast and incremental compiles and reloads to reduce development time.


Step 1:
Optimise for product market fit. 
Optimise for scale.
- Better deployment technique.
