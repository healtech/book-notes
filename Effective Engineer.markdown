### What's an Effective Engineer? 
- They are the people who get things done. Effective Engineers produce results. 

# Adopt the Right Mindsets

### Focus on High Leverage Activities
- Leverage = Impact Produced / Time Invested
- Use Leverage as Your Yardstick for Effectiveness
- 80% of the impact comes from 20% of the work.
- Focus on high leverage and not just easy wins.

### Optimize for Learning 
- Change jobs if you have to. 
- Optimizing for learning is high leverage. 
- Adopt a growth mindset. 
  - Talk to people. Become good at telling stories. It gets better with time. 
  - Those with a growth mindset believe that they can cultivate and grow their intelligence and skills through effort.
  - Own your story.

- Invest in the rate of learning
  - Compounding leads to exponential growth. Earlier the compounding starts, the better. 
  - Working on unchallenging tasks is a huge opportunity cost. You missed out on compounded learning. 
  - Prioritize learning over profitability.
  - Invest your time in activities with the highest learning rate.
  
- Seek Work Environments Conducive to Learning
  - 
  


### Invest in Iteration Speed 
- Continuous Deployment
- Will save a lot of time in manual deployment of code.They are the people who get things done. Effective Engineers produce results. 


### Reduce Operational Complexity
- Keep no. of technologies low. Don’t sway towards shiny new technologies.
- Do the simple thing first
- ** Simplicity **
- Simplify the architecture to reduce their operational burden. 
- “What’s the simplest solution that can get the job done while also reducing our future operational burden?” 

### Fail Fast 
- doesn’t necessarily mean crashing your programs for users 
- fail-fast  to surface issues immediately 

### Relentlessly Automate
- Automating mechanics is good.
- Automating decision making - no.
- Hone Your Ability to Respond and Recover Quickly 
    - Leverage ( Recovering quickly ) > Leverage ( Preventing Failures )
- “script for success,” practice failure scenarios, and work on our ability to recover quickly. 

**"You’re a staff engineer if you’re making a whole team better than it would be otherwise. You’re a principal engineer if you’re making the whole company better than it would be otherwise. And you’re distinguished if you’re improving the industry.”**
￼
- Automated testcases lead to higher confidence when refactoring.
- Write test cases when the code is fresh in mind.
- Don’t be dogmatic about 100% code coverage.
- Value of tests increases over time and cost to write goes down. 

### Technical Debt
- Taking technical debt is fine as far as it is repaid within time. 

### Measure What You Want to Improve
- If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it 
- Good Metric
    - They help you focus on the right things 
    - Drives forward progress.
- The metric you choose influences your decisions and behavior. 
- Choose metrics that  
    - 1) maximize impact, 
    - 2) are actionable, 
    - 3) are responsive yet robust. 
    
### Instagram
1. Simplicity
2. Optimise for Operational Complexity
3. Instrument Everything

- Surround yourself with great advisors


### Iteration Speed

- Continuous deployment to support rapid validation.
- High test coverage to reduce build and site breakages.
- Fast unit tests to encourage people to run them.
- Fast and incremental compiles and reloads to reduce development time.


Step 1:
Optimise for product market fit. 
Optimise for scale.
- Better deployment technique.
